# hirst-painting-python

Created a similar painting like Damien Hirst's spot paintings. 

[colorgram](https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/) python package is used to extract colors from existing Damien Hirst's spot painting.

Random colors from the extracted colors are used to generate different spots to make the paiting.

10 by 10 rows of different colored spots were created using turtle package.

Each dots are around 20 in size and spaced apart by around 50.
