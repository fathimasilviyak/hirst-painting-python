# hirst-painting-python

Created a similar painting like Damien Hirst's spot paintings. 

[colorgram](https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/) python package is used to extract colors from existing Damien Hirst's spot painting.

Random colors from the extracted colors are used to generate different spots to make the paiting.
